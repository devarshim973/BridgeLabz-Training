### 🗓 Day 25 – Java Generics Overview & Sorting Scenario Practice
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**                    
**Branch:** `dsa-practice`

#### 🔹 Solved real-world, scenario-based problems using sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort (patient criticality management)
  - Insertion Sort (real-time book arrangement)
  - Merge Sort (sales reports and student ranking)
  - Quick Sort (ticket price optimization)
Analyzed sorting behavior for small vs large datasets, stability, and performance.

#### 🔹 Created a new branch `java-collections-practice`
- Learned and applied Java Generics best practices:
  - Generic classes, methods, and constructors
  - Bounded type parameters and wildcards
  - Type safety and reusability

#### 🔹 Topics Learned
- Type safety with generics
- Generic classes, methods, and constructors
- Upper & lower bounded wildcards
- Bounded type parameters
- Avoiding raw types and type erasure pitfalls
- Designing clean and reusable generic APIs
  
#### 🔹 Implemented real-world generic systems:
  - Smart Warehouse Management
  - Online Marketplace
  - Course Management System
  - Meal Plan Generator
  - AI-Driven Resume Screening System
    
#### 🔹 Practiced problem-solving using efficient approaches and optimized logic.

### 📅 Day 26 – Sorting Scenarios & Java Collections Framework  
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**  
**Branch:** `dsa-practice`

Solved **3 real-world scenario-based sorting problems**:

- **RoboWarehouse** – Shelf loading using **Insertion Sort** (dynamic, streaming inserts)
- **CinemaHouse** – Movie showtime ordering using **Bubble Sort** (small dataset)
- **CropMonitor** – Sensor data ordering using **Quick Sort** (large, unordered data)

#### 🔹 Java Collections Framework  
**Branch:** `java-collections-practice`

Learned and practiced the **Java Collections Framework** in depth:

#### ✔ Core Topics Covered
- Collection hierarchy: `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Map`
- Implementations:
  - **List:** ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
  - **Set:** HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
  - **Queue/Deque:** PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque
  - **Map:** HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable
- Performance comparison & real-world use cases
- Best practices: generics, choosing correct collection, avoiding legacy misuse

#### ✔ Practice Problems Implemented
- **List operations:** reverse, rotate, frequency count, remove duplicates
- **Set operations:** union, intersection, subsets, sorting
- **Queue problems:** reverse queue, triage system, circular buffer
- **Map problems:** word frequency, merge maps, grouping objects
- **Mini systems:**
  - Insurance Policy Management
  - Banking System
  - Voting System
  - Shopping Cart

### 📅 Day 27 – Sorting Algorithms (Scenario-Based Practice) & Scenario-Based OOP Practice (Java) 
**(Date: 17-Jan-2026)**  
**Branch:** `dsa-practice`

Worked on **4 real-world, scenario-based problems** applying core **sorting algorithms** to practical use cases.

#### 🔹 Sorting Scenarios Implemented

- **IceCreamRush** – Sorted ice cream flavors by weekly sales using **Bubble Sort**  
  *Focus:* small dataset, simple adjacent comparisons

- **SmartLibrary** – Maintained alphabetically sorted borrowed books using **Insertion Sort**  
  *Focus:* dynamic insertion, nearly sorted data

- **ArtExpo** – Managed artist registrations sorted by time using **Insertion Sort**  
  *Focus:* real-time insertion, incremental sorting

- **FleetManager** – Combined vehicle maintenance schedules using **Merge Sort**  
  *Focus:* merging sorted sublists, scalability for large datasets

###🔹 Scenario-Based OOP Practice (Java) 
*(Date: 17-Jan-2026)*  
*Branch:* java-oops-practice

Solved *2 OOP-based scenario questions*:
- *GeoMeasure Solutions* – Line comparison using classes, constructors, encapsulation, methods, and this keyword.
- *Bag-n-Ball Organizer* – Modeled Bag–Ball relationship using classes, encapsulation, composition, and method design (capacity checks, add/remove/display).
