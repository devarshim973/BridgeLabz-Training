### 🗓 Day 1 – OOPS Concepts & Eclipse IDE Setup
*(Date: 26-Dec-2025)*

- Created a new branch named java-oops-practice.
- Set up Eclipse IDE for Java Developers. 
- Practiced Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
- Implemented OOPS-based Java programs using:
  - Classes and Objects

### Day 2 – Constructors & Access Modifiers  
*(Date: 27-Dec-2025)*Learned core OOP concepts in Java:
- Constructors in Java
  - Default Constructor
  - Parameterized Constructor
  - Copy Constructor
- Constructor Overloading
- Access Modifiers:
  - public, protected, default, private
- Instance vs Class (static) variables and methods

Implemented practice programs:
- Coffee Shop Order System (using constructors)
- School example to demonstrate static variables and methods

Improved understanding of:
- Object initialization
- Data encapsulation
- Code structure and reusability

Committed and pushed all changes successfully.

### 🗓 Day 12 – Object Modeling & Scenario-Based Programs  
*(Date: 30-Dec-2025)* 

#### 🔹 Java OOPS Practice (java-oops-practice)
Learned *Object Modeling* concepts and object communication in Java.

*Topics Covered:*
- Object Relationships (Aggregation, Association, Composition)
- Classes vs Objects
- UML Diagrams:
  - Class Diagram
  - Object Diagram
  - Sequence Diagram

#### 🔹 Core Java Practice (core-java-practice)
Solved multiple *scenario-based problems* to strengthen control flow and logic building.

*Problems Implemented:*
- 🌡️ Temperature Logger (arrays, loops, if conditions)
- 🚆 Train Reservation Queue (switch, while-loop, break)
- 🏋️ Sandeep’s Fitness Challenge Tracker (for-each, continue)
- 🎬 Movie Ticket Booking App (switch + if, loops)
- 📚 Rohan’s Library Reminder App (fine calculation using for-loop)

Focused on clean structure, proper variable naming, and modular logic.
